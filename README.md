## Overview

Roast App is a mobile application built with Expo, designed to provide a seamless development experience for both Android and iOS. This project was created using `create-expo-app` and follows a file-based routing structure.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Android, iOS, and the web.
- **Fast Development**: Uses Expo for quick prototyping.
- **File-Based Routing**: Organized structure for easier navigation.
- **Development Builds**: Supports running in simulators and Expo Go.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Expo (React Native)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **State Management**: React Context API (or Redux, if needed)
- **Styling**: Styled Components / Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm installed
- Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Installation

   cd roast-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
